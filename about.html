      <p>This website was originally created as a school project. I decided<br>
        to make this website into a place to list all of my goals and achievements,<br>
        mainly because I don't think I'm ready to have a complete personal website.<br>
        Anyway, keep in mind that this website is meant for my own benefit, and it<br>
        will serve as a "trophy" for me learning HTML and CSS.

  <p>Please keep in mind that this is a personal website not meant for spreading knowledge.<br>
    Do not criticize this website in any way due to its purpose.
