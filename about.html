    <section id="paragraph">
      <p>This website was originally created as a school project, however I still<br>
        value this website. I consider this website to be my created achievement of<br>
        all time, because it wasn't easy to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I decided<br>
        to make this website into a place to list all of my goals and achievements,<br>
        mainly because I don't think I'm ready to have a complete personal website.<br>
        Anyway, keep in mind that this website is meant for my own benefit, and it<br>
        serves as a "trophy" for me learning HTML and CSS. While you are here, consider<br>
        the time it took me to create this website and to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
